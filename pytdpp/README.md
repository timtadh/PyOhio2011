PyTDPP - Top Down Predictive Parser for Python
==============================================

by Tim Henderson

The impetus for this project came when I gave a talk at CWRU hacker society on parsing. I decided to
create a library for doing top down predictive parsing as an example to explain table driven parsing
without the complexity of a LALR parser generator. The result turned out to be quite usable although
some work currently needs to done to assist in error recovery. Additionally the generated table is
not currently stored between invocations of the python interpreter reducing the efficiency of the
final parser.
